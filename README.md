# Final Project: Focusing on Physics Libraries

## Description:
- This project will have a single ball that bounces and rolls through a series of tilted platforms using real time physics. The user can click to spawn new balls in, which also reacts to gravity and the platforms. The balls motion is affected by friction and restitution/bounciness.
